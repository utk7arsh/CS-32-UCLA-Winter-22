I didn't recieve score for my project 4. Also, if you're looking for project 3 code and spec, it would be on a seperate repo called Superpeach Sisters

https://github.com/utk7arsh/Superpeach-Sisters

The project 4 demanded a dating application which can match compatible users using efficient data structures. I do not have my solutions for midterms and finals but I got 100 in both midterms and didn't receive my final exam score. 

Note : You are welcome to have a look and take inspiration from my code in case you're stuck with an assigment but please do not copy as it would also cause you trouble. 
Good luck!!!
